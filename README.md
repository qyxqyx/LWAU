# Source code of the method LWAU shown in "Layer-Wise Adaptive Updating for Few-Shot Image Classification"

URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08129

LWAU is evaluated on two backbones:Conv-4 and ResNet12　　

The performances on MiniImagenet is shown as the following Table.　　
The upper part of the table shows the meta-learning based few-shot learning methods with Conv-4 backbone.　　
The lower part shows the methods with ResNet12 backbone.
